# To test a function's register use, call call_function
# with the normal parameters (up to 4), and the address
# of the function as the 5th parameter.
#
# call_function will verify that all callee-saved registers
# were restored properly, and will also put useless values
# in all non-argument registers (it ignores a0-a3).
#
# If an incorrect usage is detected it prints an error message
# and exits.
#
# This is just a wrapper function, so it will not catch every
# case, and incorrect use of sp or ra will likely cause it to fail.
